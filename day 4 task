Question 1:

Do the below programs in anonymous function & IIFE

  a. Print odd numbers in an array

Answer:

   numbers_array1= [3, 7, 9, 11, 17, 21]


  b. Convert all the strings to title caps in a string array

Answer: 

let word = 'apple'

let word = 'APPLE'


c.  


Answer: 

let arr = [4, 8, 7, 13, 12]

let sum = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    sum += arr[i];
}

console.log("Sum is " + sum) 

Output: 44


d. Return all the prime numbers in an array

Answer:

A prime number is a positive integer that is only divisible by 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 are the first few prime numbers.

For example, 4 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4 itself. It is a composite number.




f. Return median of two sorted arrays of the same size.

Answer: 

There are 2 sorted arrays A and B of size n each. Write an algorithm to find the median of the array obtained after merging the above 2 arrays.


g. Remove duplicates from an array

Answer: 

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. For simplicity, we can think of an array as a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value


h. Rotate an array by k times

Answer: 

A simple yet effective approach is to consider each row of the matrix as an array and perform an array rotation. This can be done by copying the elements from K to end of array to starting of array using temporary array. And then the remaining elements from start to K-1 to end of the array.



Question 2:

Do the below programs in arrow functions.


a. Print odd numbers in an array


Answer:

   numbers_array1= [3, 7, 9, 11, 17, 21]



  b. Convert all the strings to title caps in a string array

Answer: 

let word = 'apple'

let word = 'APPLE'
